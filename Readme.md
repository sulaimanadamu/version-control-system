# Version Control System (VCS)

version control system like the name implies is used to control version of software source code. This is a way to put it for the lame man, now what does the above statement mean?.

**Version control system**  is used in software development for collaboration and source code management.

source code management is important in software development process, 
with VCS different developers may have to work on different portion of the software for faster release time.
VCS allows everyone of them to submit what they have worked on without one submited code overidding the other. Incase of conflict maybe two of the team members have changed the same line the vcs will alert them to the changes by bringing up what is called a **merge conflict**.

while they can get this merge conflict, the developers can make this changes locally if they are using a tool like git and submit the solution. In terms of collaboration, with something called **PR(PULL REQUEST)** in vcs we can get others to review our code, check for errors, carry out test, write comments and send them to the developer that submitted the code therefore fostering collaboration amongst developers in the development process.

There are different version control systems like 

- subversion
- mercurial
- Git (the most popular)

There are also two types of vcs

- Centralised Version control system
- Decentralised Version control system

**Centralised version control system** are strictly server based and the history of the project are stored only on the project server. if the server goes offline there will be no way to develop the application.

In **Decentralised version control system**, every user has complete access to the project history at all time locally.
